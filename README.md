## I have lots of projects, see [the complete list here](https://willnode.github.io/)

When i was a kid, i'm mainly a game developer. Altough I'd (and will) never release a successful game, it did lead to the creation of [TEXDraw](https://u3d.as/mFe) for Unity.

I mainly a web developer now. You can play my [Web toys](https://willnode.github.io/). Don't hesitate to ask me if I want to join your project. I will help when I have time (or your project is doing someting interesting to me).


The second running project is [DOM Cloud](https://domcloud.io/), it's a open and free hosting service. Backstory because I need it most, and it hosts +10 of my own online projects, probably more later.

Go to [my website](https://wellosoft.net/) if you're curious more about myself.

If you want to support me, go follow [my twitter](https://twitter.com/willnode), or much better, use one of my products :) thanks ðŸ’•
